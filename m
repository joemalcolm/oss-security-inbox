Subject: CVE-2026-90436: Apache Axis 1.x (EOL): unauthenticated remote class instantiation via SOAP fault exceptionName 
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Severity: critical 

Affected versions:

- Apache Axis 1.x (EOL) through 1.4
- Apache Axis 1.x (EOL) through 1.4
- Apache Axis 1.x (EOL) aac718c6035435d96b39d6aebb9c078a13af7cc8 before 41f3b4e8d04e310ca81f86b92630ab2c11d608bd

Description:

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Deserialization of an inbound SOAP fault in Apache Axis 1.x allows unauthenticated remote class instantiation. When a SOAP <Fault> carries a <detail><exceptionName> element, Axis loads the named class and, if a String <data> element is also present, instantiates it through its String constructor before checking that it is an AxisFault. Loading alone runs the class's static initializer. With a suitable class on the application's classpath this leads to remote code execution. The fault is parsed while the engine resolves the target service, before any per-service handler chain runs, so authentication handlers configured on a service do not protect against it. This affects all Apache Axis 1.x versions through 1.4.



As Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. Alternatively you could use a build of Axis with the patch from https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/41f3b4e8d04e310ca81f86b92630ab2c11d608bd applied. The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release fixing this problem.
