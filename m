Subject: CVE-2026-46242 ("Bad Epoll") local privilege escalation on Linux, including Android
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Hey,

Similar to the "GhostLock" vulnerability Thomas Orgis
just shared, there appears to be another LPE named
"Bad Epoll" and tracked as CVE-2026-46242.

https://github.com/J-jaeyoung/bad-epoll

That repository's README follows:

---
Bad Epoll (CVE-2026-46242) is a race-condition
use-after-free in the Linux kernel's epoll subsystem.
This bug lets an unprivileged process become root, not
only on Linux desktops and servers but also on Android
devices.

Bad Epoll was reported and exploited by [Jaeyoung
Chung](https://j-jaeyoung.github.io/) as a 0-day
submission to Google
[kernelCTF](https://google.github.io/security-research/kernelctf/rules.html),
which rewards a Linux kernel exploit with $71,337+.

Note

Anthropic's AI,
[Mythos](https://red.anthropic.com/2026/mythos-preview/),
found another [race
bug](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=07712db80857d5d09ae08f3df85a708ecfc3b61f)
in the same epoll code but missed Bad Epoll.

Why it is serious

    A rare bug that can root Android. Most Linux
privilege-escalation bugs cannot root Android at all.
[Copy Fail](https://copy.fail/) and its variants, for
example, need modules that Android never loads. Out of
the roughly 130 vulnerabilities exploited on Google's
kernelCTF, only about ten are candidates for rooting
Android. Bad Epoll is one of them.

	Bad Epoll can also be triggered from inside
Chrome's renderer sandbox, which blocks almost every
other kernel bug. A renderer exploit could therefore
chain with Bad Epoll to achieve kernel code
execution, the same impact Project Zero demonstrated
in "[From Chrome renderer code exec to kernel with
MSG_OOB](https://projectzero.google/2025/08/from-chrome-renderer-code-exec-to-kernel.html)".

    No kill-switch. Copy Fail and its variants can be
neutralized by unloading their vulnerable modules, but
epoll has no such option. It is a core kernel feature
that the operating system, network services, and
browsers all rely on. The only way to fix it is to
apply the patch.

    Tiny race window, but the attack is 99% reliable.
The bug's race window is only about six instructions
wide, and a normal attempt almost never hits it. The
exploit widens that window and runs a retry loop
that never crashes the kernel. The result is a 99%
reliable exploit, as the [attack
overview](https://github.com/J-jaeyoung/bad-epoll#how-the-attack-works)
below describes.

The bug Mythos missed

A single
[commit](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=58c9b016e128)
in 2023 introduced two separate race conditions into
the epoll code, only about 2,500 lines in all. Both
turned out to be critical bugs that can lead to
privilege escalation.

The first was found by Anthropic's
[Mythos](https://red.anthropic.com/2026/mythos-preview/)
and reported as
[CVE-2026-43074](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=07712db80857d5d09ae08f3df85a708ecfc3b61f).
That result is impressive on its own, because kernel
race bugs are known to be hard to find. It showed a
frontier AI model's ability to find race bugs. An
independent researcher later submitted a [1-day
exploit](https://github.com/2045castor/security-research/blob/submit_final/pocs/linux/kernelctf/CVE-2026-43074_lts/docs/exploit.md)
for it to kernelCTF.

The other race is Bad Epoll, which Mythos missed.
Given that Mythos found the first bug in this small
epoll code path, it likely examined the same area with
meaningful depth. We cannot know exactly why it missed
Bad Epoll, but two factors likely made it hard to
find.

    The race window is tiny. It is only about six
instructions wide, so the exact thread interleaving is
hard to imagine even when looking at the vulnerable
code.

    There was little runtime evidence. After
CVE-2026-43074 is fixed, Bad Epoll's use-after-free
usually does not trigger KASAN, the kernel's main
memory-error detector. Without that signal, Mythos may
not have had enough confidence to report it as a real
bug.

Bad Epoll was hard to fix, too. The maintainers' first
patch did not fully fix the issue, and a correct patch
landed only two months after the bug was first
reported. That is a long time for a kernel that
usually handles security issues with urgency.

Overall, Bad Epoll shows how difficult race conditions
are at every stage. They are hard to find even for a
frontier model, hard to fix correctly, and, as the
next section shows, hard to exploit reliably. It also
suggests a vulnerability research direction that
remains worth exploring in the presence of frontier AI
models: uncovering real security impact behind narrow
timing conditions and weak evidence.
How the attack works

Here is a high-level overview of the attack, for the
curious.

ep_waiter watches ep_target: the epoll structures
behind the bug

Two linked epoll objects. Closing both at once
triggers the race.

Two of epoll's close paths run at the same time and
collide. One frees an object while the other is still
writing into it, and that is the use-after-free (UAF).

The close-vs-close race window and how the exploit
drives it through a timer interrupt

The race window, and how the exploit drives it.

The exploit uses four epoll objects grouped into two
pairs. One pair triggers the race, while the other
becomes the victim. From there, the exploit turns the
8-byte UAF write into a UAF on a file object, and uses
a cross-cache attack to fully control the file's
contents.

Arbitrary kernel read: a dangling struct file backed
by a pipe leaks kernel addresses through
/proc/self/fdinfo

Turning the bug into an arbitrary kernel memory read
through /proc/self/fdinfo.

With that control, the exploit gains an arbitrary read
of kernel memory through /proc/self/fdinfo. Finally,
it hijacks control flow and executes a ROP chain to
gain a root shell.

Mitigation

Because epoll cannot be disabled, Bad Epoll has no
simple workaround. The only remedy is to apply the
patch.

    Apply upstream commit
[a6dc643c6931](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a6dc643c69311677c574a0f17a3f4d66a5f3744b),
or your distribution's backport once it becomes
available.

and fixed by
[a6dc643c6931](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a6dc643c69311677c574a0f17a3f4d66a5f3744b)

Many Linux distributions may be affected if they use
kernels based on v6.4 or newer and have not yet
backported the fix. Check your distribution's kernel
security updates for a backport of the fix commit
above. Older v6.1-based kernels are not affected
because the bug was introduced in v6.4.

The current exploit is written for the following
Google kernelCTF targets.

    lts-6.12.67 (LTS), 99% reliable
    cos-121-18867.294.100 (COS), 98% reliable

The Android exploit is still in progress.

    Pixel 10 (kernel v6.6+): the current PoC triggers
the UAF and a full root exploit is in progress. We
will release the Android exploit and writeup once they
are complete.
    Pixel 8 and other v6.1-based devices: not
affected, since the bug was introduced in v6.4.

kernel bugs, whose earlier entries include [Bad
Binder](https://projectzero.google/2019/11/bad-binder-android-in-wild-exploit.html),
[Bad
IO_uring](https://github.com/Markakd/bad_io_uring),

Epoll is the epoll counterpart.
