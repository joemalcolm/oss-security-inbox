Cryptsetup only uses AF_ALG for certain operations like keyslot
encryption, and only in certain cases: Cryptsetup's default settings
work fine with all CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_* options disabled in the
kernel.  The actual I/O to/from encrypted partitions is handled by
dm-crypt in the kernel and has nothing to do with AF_ALG.

Cryptsetup even already supports userspace crypto libraries as well.  It
seems there are just some gaps in how it's using them.  For example for
AES-GCM it seems to just go directly to AF_ALG, despite the cryptsetup
binary already being linked to OpenSSL, which means a complete userspace
implementation of AES-GCM is already present in its address space!

I'm hoping that at least some of these ideas for attack surface
reduction (requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN, allowlisting the algorithms,
removing splice support) can be implemented in parallel without waiting
for every userspace program to stop using these UAPIs.  Full removal
needs to be the goal, though.

It's unfortunate that the situation with userspace crypto libraries is
fragmented, with the de facto standard one (OpenSSL) not being all that
great.  But that's no excuse to say "put it all in the kernel".  Even
using OpenSSL would still be much better.
