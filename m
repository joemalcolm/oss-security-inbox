"cp -a" doesn't fail if used to copy from a nosuid mount to a suid
mount, right?  Should it?

I understand the psychology behind this: people think copy-up is done
by the current (unprivileged) user, because it's triggered by the
current user.   But copy up isn't done by the current user, it's done
by the mounting user (i.e .with the privileges of the mounting task).

The reason for this is that in many cases copy up *can not* be
performed by the current task.  Just think of the case where e.g. root
owned parent directory needs to be copied up before the user writable
file is copied up.

This means that it's the responsibility of the mounting user to ensure
that copy-up does not compromise security, since the current
(unprivileged) user will be able to *trigger* operations done with the
privileges of the mounting user, such as the scenario described in
this CVE.

Thanks,
Miklos
