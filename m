Subject: Re: [oss-security] CVE-2024-42154: Linux kernel: tcp_metrics: validate source addr length

Hi Joel,

When you bring issues to this list, please include in the Subject and
start your messages with information on the issue itself - at least the
affected project and vulnerability type when applicable.  As a
moderator, I've edited the Subject line to contain such information.

I didn't fully analyze this issue, but at a glance:

1. NIST NVD commonly inflates CVSS scores.  You could reasonably dispute
their CVSS vector and they may correct it and the score:

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42154

Base Score:  9.8 CRITICAL
Vector:  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

2. There are other sources for CVSS vectors/scores, notably Red Hat:

https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-42154

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

leading to a score of 2.5.  Indeed, they treat this issue as local, not
network, which is probably correct, although some other components of
this CVSS vector look weird to me.

You could use Red Hat as your source of severity scores.

3. The CVE description originates from Linux kernel CNA, which in turn
reuses the commit message:

https://lists.openwall.net/linux-cve-announce/2024/07/30/76

The code change is:

+++ b/net/ipv4/tcp_metrics.c
@@ -624,6 +624,7 @@ static const struct nla_policy tcp_metrics_nl_policy[TCP_METRICS_ATTR_MAX + 1] =
 	[TCP_METRICS_ATTR_ADDR_IPV4]	= { .type = NLA_U32, },
 	[TCP_METRICS_ATTR_ADDR_IPV6]	= { .type = NLA_BINARY,
 					    .len = sizeof(struct in6_addr), },
+	[TCP_METRICS_ATTR_SADDR_IPV4]	= { .type = NLA_U32, },
 	/* Following attributes are not received for GET/DEL,
 	 * we keep them for reference
 	 */

It would require more context to review and to assess the bug's impact,
but my _guess_ is it may have been merely over-read potential, so local
infoleak maybe?  Besides code review, it could make sense to locate the
corresponding syzbot report, if one exists, and see what type of crash
it was - if it was.

Somehow Red Hat's description lists possibilities worse than over-read,
so either my guess is wrong or they didn't analyze the issue to identify
specific impact:

I hope this helps.
