Subject: GNU GRUB 2.14: serial-MMIO lockdown bypass in Canonical-signed gcdx64.efi
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

== Overview ==

Canonical-signed GRUB2 (grub-efi-amd64-signed), when admitted by UEFI
Secure Boot and reporting lockdown=y, exposes a serial command that accepts
a caller-supplied 64-bit MMIO base address. The lockdown path does not
restrict this command, and the serial implementation does not validate that
the requested register span belongs to a real UART rather than ordinary RAM.

A local attacker with control of GRUB's boot configuration can use the
lockdown-available "gdbinfo" command to recover the image base, point the
serial MMIO base at GRUB's authoritative grub_file_verifiers list head, and
trigger input-only serial initialization. The fixed UART initialization
stores clear that list head. GRUB's empty-verifier-list behavior then fails
open, admitting unsigned GRUB modules while lockdown still reports y.

Exploitation requires control of a GRUB configuration source accepted
without
configuration authentication, control of or ability to select that boot
path,
continued shim/SBAT admission of the affected image, a structurally valid
unsigned native GRUB module, knowledge of the loaded image placement, and a
serial input poll. Administrator-controlled boot configuration or controlled
removable media are representative routes; root or physical access alone
does
not establish every prerequisite. This is not a remote or ordinary-user
vector.

== Affected ==

Product:            GNU GRUB (GRUB2)
Confirmed image:    Ubuntu grub-efi-amd64-signed 1.215+2.14-2ubuntu1
                    gcdx64.efi.signed SHA-256:

dc505a15c1bd97878eede212a052a1bfb2f610176a5401a3679877c536fdcd62
Underlying build:   grub2 2.14-2ubuntu1
SBAT:               grub,5; grub.ubuntu,2; grub.ubuntu26,1; grub.peimage,2
Architecture:       x86-64

The sibling images grubx64.efi.signed and grubnetx64.efi.signed from the
same package share the relevant .text, .data, serial implementation, and
lockdown command set. They are static audit candidates only; live
reproduction
used only gcdx64.efi.signed.

The serial MMIO implementation is upstream GRUB code
(grub-core/term/ns8250.c
and grub-core/term/serial.c), present in source versions containing ns8250
MMIO serial support. Other signed builds containing the same path and
lockdown
command set require audit; this advisory does not claim cross-build or
cross-distribution reproduction. No claim is made for arm64 or other
architectures without independent verification.

Outside confirmed scope:
                    Any build other than the exact gcdx64.efi.signed image
                    identified above, and all physical-hardware deployments.

== Root cause ==

GRUB2's serial command, when given --port=mmio,<address>.q, passes the
address directly to the serial MMIO driver without validating that it falls
within a legitimate UART resource. Under lockdown, neither the serial
command nor the gdbinfo command is restricted. The serial initialization
sequence writes fixed UART-derived values (IER, LCR, DLL, DLM, FCR, and MCR)
at register-relative offsets from the supplied base.

In .q mode, UART registers use an eight-byte stride. With --speed=450, the
computed divisor is 0x0100; the fixed DLL/register-zero store writes the
zero
low divisor byte at the supplied base, clearing grub_file_verifiers. Other
UART-derived stores land at subsequent register slots. This is a
caller-selected destination with fixed UART-derived values, not an
arbitrary-value write. GRUB's file-open path treats an empty verifier list
as
"no verifiers registered" and returns success, a known fail-open behavior
(cf. CVE-2025-0622 / Grabit).

The closest root-cause mapping is CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference).

== Demonstrated chain ==

  lockdown-active Canonical GRUB
    -> serial --port=mmio,<grub_file_verifiers_addr>.q targets ordinary RAM
    -> UART init stores clear the verifier list head
    -> insmod loads unsigned GRUB module
    -> benign module command executes
    -> lockdown still reports y throughout

== Reproduction ==

Environment: QEMU 8.2.2, q35, SMM enabled, TCG, OVMF 2024.02-2ubuntu0.9
with Microsoft UEFI CA enrolled (standard ms.fd), Ubuntu shim 15.8. Three
successful runs on enforcing, disposable VMs.

Reproduction requires a FAT boot medium containing the signed shim, the
signed
GRUB, an unsigned native GRUB module (e.g. a minimally patched hello.mod),
and
a grub.cfg containing the precomputed verifier-head address for the exact
observed image placement.

The configuration for the confirmed image and load address:

  # verify the expected image placement with gdbinfo
  gdbinfo
  # gdbinfo prints: dynamic_load_symbols 0x1c776000
  # ImageBase = 0x1c776000 - 0x1000 = 0x1c775000
  # grub_file_verifiers RVA = 0x1e1d8
  # runtime address = 0x1c7931d8

  serial --port=mmio,1c7931d8.q --speed=450 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1
--rtscts=off
  sleep 30  # verify gdbinfo placement; terminate if it differs
  terminal_input --append serial
  sleep --interruptible 1
  insmod /ap-marker.mod   # now succeeds; previously rejected

The reproduced grub.cfg does not parse or compute from gdbinfo output. It
embeds 0x1c7931d8, derived in advance for the confirmed image and observed
placement. gdbinfo is a placement check: it must report
dynamic_load_symbols 0x1c776000. If it differs, stop before the input poll.
This PoC does not automatically adapt to other builds or load addresses.

Controls demonstrated:
  - Unsigned EFI application directly:       firmware Access Denied
  - Same unsigned module before serial:      "prohibited by secure boot
policy"
  - Same module after configure-only:        still rejected (no input poll
yet)
  - Same module after input poll:            accepted, executes

Memory observations by the final post-transition checkpoint (QEMU HMP
read-only xp):
  - Before input poll: grub_file_verifiers = 0x1c7833e0 (non-null, active)
  - Final checkpoint:  grub_file_verifiers = 0x0 (cleared)
  - Adjacent get_time_ms_func at target-8:  0x1c77dadd (unchanged in both)
  - Subsequent qwords changed consistently with the fixed UART stores; this
    proof does not claim single-write isolation

== Impact ==

An attacker satisfying the stated prerequisites can execute
attacker-supplied
native GRUB module code inside the admitted, lockdown-active GRUB
environment,
despite firmware having denied an unsigned EFI control and the signed chain
remaining intact.

A loaded native GRUB module executes in GRUB's address space with that
pre-OS
principal's authority. This breaks the signed-code boundary at the GRUB
module
layer; it is not firmware StartImage execution.

Live reproduction is limited to the exact Canonical-signed image identified
above in an enforcing disposable QEMU/OVMF environment. This does NOT
demonstrate physical-hardware execution, persistence, Secure Boot key or
SBAT
modification, automatic OS compromise, sibling-image execution, cross-build
exploitability, or any effect surviving power-off. The proof stops at benign
native module execution.

CVSS 3.1: 6.4
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

AC:H reflects deployment-specific configuration acceptance, image placement,
and precomputed target preparation. PR:H scores the coherent
administrator-controlled route; physical access is not mixed into this
vector.

== Prior art ==

The 2025 "Grabit" work (CVE-2025-0622) documents corruption/nulling of
grub_file_verifiers and GRUB's fail-open empty-verifier-list behavior
via a distinct use-after-free primitive. This advisory claims no novelty
for those downstream techniques. The new primitive is that lockdown-active
GRUB permits attacker-selected serial MMIO to target ordinary RAM,
producing fixed UART initialization stores that clear security-sensitive
state.

== Remediation ==

1. In lockdown, reject caller-selected raw MMIO serial bases. If serial
   input is required under lockdown, allow only platform-described,
   validated UART resources (e.g. SPCR/ACPI platform tables).
2. Validate the register span, access width, and memory resource type
   before any serial register access. Reject ordinary RAM and unknown
   ranges.
3. Make file opens fail closed when the authoritative verifier collection
   is missing or empty while Secure Boot lockdown is active.
4. Restrict gdbinfo in lockdown as defense in depth (not the primary fix).
5. Rebuild and sign corrected images, increment the appropriate SBAT
   generation, and stage revocation only after fixed media is available.
