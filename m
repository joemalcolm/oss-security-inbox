========================================================================

   Distribution:  Socket
       Versions:  before 2.041

Socket versions before 2.041 for Perl have an out-of-bounds heap read

Description
-----------
Socket versions before 2.041 for Perl have an out-of-bounds heap read.

In Socket.xs, pack_ip_mreq_source() checks the length of its source
argument before the argument is read, so the check tests the byte
length carried over from the preceding multiaddr argument instead. Both
addresses occupy a 4-byte field, so a valid multiaddr lets a source of
any length pass the check, and the source is then copied into the
4-byte imr_sourceaddr field with a fixed-size copy. A source shorter
than 4 bytes is not rejected, and the copy reads up to 3 bytes past the
end of its buffer.

Calling pack_ip_mreq_source() with a source value shorter than 4 bytes
copies adjacent heap memory into the returned packed structure.

Problem types
-------------
- CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read
- CWE-805 Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value

Solutions
---------
Upgrade to version 2.041 or later.
